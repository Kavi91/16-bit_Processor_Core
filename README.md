# 16-bit_Processor_Core - System Verilog

The primary objective of this project revolves around the development of a 16-bit instruction set processor. The processor is designed using SystemVerilog and is a comprehensive educational tool for understanding the inner workings of a CPU at the register-transfer level (RTL).

## Key Components

The design comprises the following key components:

1. **Program Counter (PC)** - Responsible for tracking the program's execution.
2. **Instruction Register (IR)** - Stores the current instruction being processed.
3. **Control Unit (CU)** - Manages and coordinates the processor's operations.
4. **Register Bank (RB)** - Houses registers for data storage and manipulation.
5. **Function Unit (FU)** - Handles various computational functions.
6. **2x16 Multiplexer (MUXM)** - Used for data selection and routing.
7. **3x16 Multiplexer (MUXD)** - Enables versatile data selection and control.
8. **2x16 Multiplexer (MUXB)** - Facilitates flexible data routing.

## Architecture and Development

The architectural design of this processor core incorporates a SystemVerilog model created at the register level, synthesized using the QuestaSim Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Siemens. To verify the functionality of each RTL model, manual testbenches and test programs were written, and the generated waveforms within the IDE were utilized to validate the functionality of individual RTL modules and the overall design.

## Technologies and Tools

- **QuestaSim IDE:** For writing, simulating, and synthesizing the SystemVerilog model.
- **Gate-level Validation:** Ensuring the precision of simulation outcomes derived from RTL synthesis.
- **Formality Report:** Generated by the Qautocheck wizard to examine connectivity and potential errors within the RTL model.
- **Synopsys Design Vision Tool:** Analyzing design cost, performance, area, resource utilization, power consumption, and timing for optimization.

## Interface Signals

- `clk`: Rising edge sensitive clock signal input
- `rst_n`: Active-low asynchronous reset input
- `a_out`: Memory address bus
- `d_out`: Memory data write bus
- `d_in`: Memory data read bus
- `io_in`: Parallel input-output device (IOPORT) read bus
- `iom_out`: Select the signal that indicates the address and write data meant for the memory or I/O device
